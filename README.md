MagB_inv: A high performance Matlab program for estimating the magnetic basement relief by inverting magnetic anomalies
A MATLAB based program, including an easy-to-use graphical interface, is presented to estimate 3D geometry of magnetic basement interfaces from their gridded magnetic anomalies by a rapid iterative procedure.
The developed code uses an algorithm based on a relationship between the Fourier transforms of the magnetic data and the interface topography.
Given the average depth to the magnetic interface and parameters related to the magnetization, the iterative procedure built up in the frequency domain results with accurate depth estimates in a very short computing time, making the program capable also for handling large data sets
